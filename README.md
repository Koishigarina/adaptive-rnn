# Modified_RNN
Code for the library radius nearest neighbor(RNN) classifier and modified RNN, tested on 6 standard datasets Iris, Wine, Pima, Ionosphere, Sonar, Liver. 

# Motivation
The nearest neighbor classifier assumes constant local class conditional probabilities. The assumption breaks near decision boundaries. The proposed method is an extension of the radius nearest neighbor classifier that adapts the inference procedure depending on the proximity of the test example to decision boundaries. 

# Requirements
Code is written in Python 3 and requires the following libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`.
